<h1>Playing</h1>

1. Wait for the game to finish loading.<br>
2. From the main menu, choosing "Start" will begin the game. "Instructions" will tell the player how to control the game. "Settings" gives you the option to turn off potentially distracting animated elements in the game. "Credits" will display the names of the people involved in creating Leaps and Bounds.<br>
3. After clicking "Start", choose which environment you want to play in ("Basic", "Campus", "Night Sky") by clicking on the matching image. Players can choose to return to the main menu from any environment by clicking on the menu button in the lower right hand corner.<br>
4. Once the environment loads, click on the green Play button to begin the trial. There is no time limit for picking each option, but players should still try to go through each trial quickly and accurately.<br>
5. Press the left or right arrow keys to choose which object is described by the target word. Players may also use the S and K keys to move left and right, respectively. To facilitate players with motor impairment, any of the keys around the S and K keys will also register as a left or a right choice.<br>
6. At the end of a trial, players will see a summary of their performance. From there, they may choose to redo the trial or return to the main menu and pick a different environment.<br>
